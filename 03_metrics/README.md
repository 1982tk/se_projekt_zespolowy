# Metrics for Effective Teams

## Execution

- **DORA**: Deployment freq, Lead time, failure freq, 
- [SPACE](https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/03/space-developer-productivity/)

<!--
At the current iteration (tech < 20 engineers), no issues with quality, focus on flow of delivery:
Deployment Frequency:
production
      I track the whole system (as the primary  KPI) and per component (supportive, to have it for detailed discussions or as data for the retrospective).
Mean Lead Time for Change - from opening PR as a draft, in our company, we open such a PR as a very first step. Ar our scale, it is sufficient.
Change Failure Rate - I do not track it precisely; I update a Google Spreadsheet/Google Notebook when it happens.
Mean Time to Recovery - I consider only incidents P1 and P2.
On which metrics you focus first, it depends on the size of your engineering and your current challenges.
I bring at the 1on1 and retros DF and Lead Time; there were a few times when we talked about CFR.
