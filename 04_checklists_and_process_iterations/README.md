- broken window and trust.

## Checklists

To improve in iterations (retro, post-mortems):

- Release checklists,
- Test checklists,
- Checklist/runbooks for the incident management,
- ...
- Complex roll-out, e.g., migrations

Demos ensures that we are aligned, even if there is "nothing to show".

### Incident management

- Checklists
- Runbooks

### Test Checklist

Promote best practises accross your organization. Bring unknown-unknows, help people realize what they do not know.

### Release checklists

- Ensure we are aligned (clarity):

  - product,
  - solution engineers,
  - support,
  - designers.

  e.g., the final demo. We might need a training session.

- Coordination:

  - agree the plan with marketing and sales,
  - have th communication around the new functionality.

- Roll-out:

  - alpha, beta, % rollout

- Is monitoring in place? Both tech & business,

- ensure we have a retro to sum the whole project.
